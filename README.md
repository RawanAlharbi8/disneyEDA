## 🔍 Key Insights (and why they matter)

### 🍿 What Type of Content Rules?
**TV Shows vs Movies?**  
Spoiler: Movies win in sheer volume.  
🧠 *Business angle:* If TV Show watch time is higher per user, Disney might benefit from investing more in episodic content with longer lifespans.

### 🌎 What’s Hot and Where?
**Top genres per country** show that content taste varies globally. For example, “Family” and “Animation” dominate the U.S., while “action” might be huge in other regions.  
🧠 *Business angle:* Localization and region-targeted content creation = happier subscribers = more retention!

### 🎬 Genre Royalty
**Most common genre?** "Family" — which honestly, obvious.  
🧠 *Business angle:* Leaning into the “family-first” brand identity keeps Disney unique in the crowded streaming market.

### 📈 Content Over Time
We tracked how Disney+ has been ramping up content each year. There was a clear growth spike after 2019 — aka, Disney+ launch year.  
🧠 *Business angle:* Keep that momentum! Backload releases during low-engagement months to even out viewing.

### ⏳ Show Lengths & Movie Durations
TV shows are mostly short-seasoned, while most movies stay within 90–100 minutes.  
🧠 *Business angle:* More bingeable mini-series? Longer-form storytelling for core fans? The data’s open for interpretation!
